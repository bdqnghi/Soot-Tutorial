# Soot Tutorial
This is the tutorial for using Soot and Flowdroid to analyze Java and Android application.

## Installation

The first step is to download the Soot .jar file. 
My suggestion is not to download the Soot from the official web page: https://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/soot_download.html
since the versions there are outdated.
Instead, building from the source from here is better way: https://github.com/Sable/soot. I have prebuilt one version here: 
https://github.com/bdqnghi/Soot-Tutorial/blob/master/lib/soot-3.0.1.jar

Either using Eclipse and Intellij to import the project and add the soot-3.0.1.jar above in to the class path of the project

An example of correctly imported project can be seen here:
